# 💰 Afthonia: Financial Sovereignty Firewall

## Overview
Afthonia is a binary-optimized financial sovereignty system designed to detect fraud, reclaim forgotten assets, optimize financial flows, and restore trust using symbolic intelligence. Built in Rust for maximum performance, Afthonia integrates six core modules and advanced pattern recognition to deliver real-time, high-speed financial analysis.

## Features
- **Entity Tracker:** Symbolic mapping of financial relationships, shell company detection, and ownership chain analysis using binary pattern matching.
- **Reputation Engine:** Mythic scoring of transparency and integrity, bias detection, and manipulation indicators with bitfield operations.
- **Payment Firewall:** Real-time fraud detection, micro-transaction monitoring, and binary transaction signature analysis.
- **Heirship Scanner:** Asset recovery for dormant accounts and inheritances, binary genealogy trees, and legal step generation.
- **Tax Integrity Layer:** Tax and credit audit system with fairness analysis, discrimination detection, and manipulation indicators using parallel processing.
- **Sovereign Ledger Dashboard:** Real-time analytics, symbolic overlays, binary data streaming, and optimization path mapping.
- **Symbolic Intelligence:** Advanced pattern recognition, entropy analysis, and symbolic reasoning for anomaly detection and optimization.

## Installation
1. **Clone the repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone <your-repo-url>
   cd finance
   ```
2. **Build the project:**
   ```bash
   cargo build --release
   ```
3. **Run the CLI:**
   ```bash
   ./target/release/afthonia --help
   ```

## Usage
### Benchmark Binary Optimization
```bash
./target/release/afthonia benchmark --binary-mode --size large --iterations 5
```

### Entity Analysis
```bash
./target/release/afthonia entity --entity business --depth 7 --detect-shells --ownership-chain --binary-mode
```

### Payment Monitoring
```bash
./target/release/afthonia payment --account "Test-Account-123" --mode all --realtime --binary-analysis --binary-mode
```

### Comprehensive Audit
```bash
./target/release/afthonia audit --target "Financial-System-Alpha" --comprehensive --binary-optimize --binary-mode --threads 8
```

### Real-Time Dashboard
```bash
./target/release/afthonia dashboard --port 8080 --symbolic-overlays --binary-streaming --binary-mode --refresh-interval 5
```

## Impact
- **Fraud Detection:** High-speed binary pattern matching enables real-time identification of fraudulent transactions, shell companies, and manipulation schemes.
- **Asset Recovery:** Advanced genealogy and ownership chain mapping facilitate the recovery of dormant and forgotten assets.
- **Trust Restoration:** Symbolic intelligence and reputation scoring restore transparency and trust in financial systems.
- **Tax & Credit Fairness:** Parallelized audits detect discrimination and bias, ensuring fair access to financial resources.
- **Performance:** Binary optimization and parallel processing deliver industry-leading speed and efficiency for large-scale financial analysis.
