# DominionOS: Humanity Protector Edition

## Mission
DominionOS is an open, multi-domain AI operating system for drones—air, land, and sea—designed to protect, reclaim, and serve humanity. It is built for ethical, legal, and compassionate use only.

## Core Architecture
- **Kernel**: Real-time, secure, modular (Rust/C)
- **Swarm Logic**: Distributed, adaptive, protection-first (Go)
- **AI & Payload**: Python for rapid prototyping, C++ for performance
- **Comms**: Multi-band, mesh, SDR, satellite, LoRa, optical, acoustic
- **Firmware**: Secure, updatable, and open

## Key Principles
- Protection-first: No offensive use, only defense and reclamation
- Multi-domain: Air, land, sea
- Swarm intelligence: Coordination, adaptation, and compassion
- Symbolic perception: Pattern, anomaly, and intent recognition
- Open-source and transparent

## Getting Started
1. Study open-source drone OSes (PX4, ArduPilot, Meshtastic, GNU Radio)
2. Prototype in simulation (Gazebo, AirSim, PX4 SITL)
3. Build and test modules in `/kernel`, `/swarm`, `/ai`, `/comms`, `/firmware`
4. Document everything in `/docs`

## Legal & Ethical Notice
DominionOS is for research, humanitarian, and protective purposes only. Offensive, malicious, or illegal use is strictly prohibited.
