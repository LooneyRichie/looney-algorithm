# Runoff Resonator

## What is Runoff Resonator?

**Runoff Resonator is both a powerful detection engine and a professional money recovery service.**

- At its core, it is a modular, Rust-powered system that scans public data, government APIs, and financial records to detect lost, unclaimed, or misdirected money—at scale.
- On top of this engine, you offer a hands-on service: you do the hard work of actually recovering that money for real people, handling all the paperwork, phone calls, and bureaucracy so your clients don’t have to.

---

## Technical Engine: How the Detection Works

- **Resonator Kernel:** Orchestrates modules and manages data flow
- **Module Registry:** Plug-and-play system for loading detection modules (e.g., procurement, tax refunds, SNAP, Medicaid, HUD, grants)
- **Signal Storage:** PostgreSQL-based, with full audit trails and metadata
- **Configurable:** Environment-aware, easy to add new modules
- **Sample Modules:**
  - Procurement Watcher: Finds duplicate payments and overpricing
  - IRS Refund Probe: Tracks unclaimed tax refunds
  - SNAP/Medicaid/HUD/Grant modules: Detect unused or misallocated benefits

**All modules operate on public data only.**

## The Service: Robin Hood in the Code

**Because getting your money back can be a real hassle.**

- You use the detection engine to find real, actionable opportunities for clients
- Clients fill out a simple intake form on your website
- You do all the hard work: research, forms, phone calls, follow-ups
- You only get paid if you recover money for them (success-based fee)
- You document every step, building trust and transparency

---

## How It Works (End-to-End)

1. **Detection:** The Rust engine scans for signals of lost/unclaimed money
2. **Intake:** Clients submit their info via the website (see “Start Recovery”)
3. **Case Creation:** You log each case, research the claim, and plan the recovery
4. **Action:** You execute the recovery—forms, calls, disputes, filings
5. **Result:** Client gets paid, you collect a fee only if successful
6. **Audit Trail:** Every action is logged for transparency and improvement
