# üè• Healthcare Fracture Sealer

**AI-Powered Healthcare Fraud Detection & Optimization System**

---

## Overview

Healthcare Fracture Sealer is a Rust-based, ultra-optimized platform designed to revolutionize healthcare fraud detection, misdiagnosis prevention, and system efficiency. It leverages binary optimizations, parallel processing, and advanced AI modules to save billions in healthcare waste.

---

## Features

- **Symbolic Health Graph Builder**: Connects fragmented patient data for pattern detection.
- **AI Diagnostic Engine**: Prevents misdiagnoses with high confidence scoring.
- **Billing Audit Layer**: Detects fraud, phantom codes, duplicates, and insurance manipulation.
- **Behavioral Sentinel**: Monitors for neglect, abuse, and mental health risks.
- **Real-Time Dashboard**: Visualizes savings and system optimization live.

---

## Usage

### Command-Line Interface

Run the main binary with available commands:

```bash
./target/release/healthcare_fracture_sealer --help
```

#### Main Commands

- `health-graph`  
  Build symbolic health graphs for patient data.
  ```bash
  ./target/release/healthcare_fracture_sealer health-graph --data-source ./patient_data --output health_graph.json --workers 16 --encoding-depth 5 --realtime-anomaly
  ```

- `diagnose`  
  Run AI-powered diagnostic analysis.
  ```bash
  ./target/release/healthcare_fracture_sealer diagnose --patient test_patient --misdiagnosis-check --symbolic-logic --threshold 0.95
  ```

- `billing-audit`  
  Audit billing records for fraud and anomalies.
  ```bash
  ./target/release/healthcare_fracture_sealer billing-audit --billing-data test_billing --phantom-codes --duplicate-detection --insurance-analysis --sensitivity 9 --workers 32
  ```

- `behavior-sentinel`  
  Monitor behavioral risks and recommend interventions.
  ```bash
  ./target/release/healthcare_fracture_sealer behavior-sentinel --logs-path system_logs --patient-data patient_behavior --monitor-providers --system-analysis --mental-health-detection --alert-threshold 8
  ```

- `dashboard`  
  Launch the real-time savings dashboard.
  ```bash
  ./target/release/healthcare_fracture_sealer dashboard --port 3000 --savings-counter --entropy-overlay --open-browser --refresh-rate 5
  ```
  Access the dashboard at [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000)
