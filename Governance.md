# üèõÔ∏è Ultra Seeker: Governance & Civic Infrastructure Module

**Mission:** Detect manipulation, optimize resource flows, and restore integrity across public systems using symbolic intelligence.

## Overview

This comprehensive civic integrity and governance monitoring system provides six powerful modules designed to restore trust and transparency in public systems through advanced symbolic intelligence and pattern detection.

## üîπ Available Modules

### 1. Resource Flow Sentinel
**Purpose:** Track aid, benefits, and public funds from origin to destination
- **Detects:** Misrouting, bottlenecks, and siphoning
- **Outputs:** Flow map + anomaly alerts + recovery recommendations

```bash
cargo run -- resource-flow --source "Federal Database" --detect-anomalies
```

### 2. Symbolic Licensing Engine
**Purpose:** Validate permits, licenses, and certifications using symbolic lineage
- **Detects:** Forged documents, expired credentials, and ghost approvals
- **Outputs:** Verified license graph + fraud probability score

```bash
cargo run -- licensing --database "State License DB" --fraud-detection
```

### 3. Demographic Integrity Scanner
**Purpose:** Audit census data, voter rolls, and population records
- **Detects:** Manipulation, duplication, and undercounting
- **Outputs:** Integrity score + flagged regions + optimization path

```bash
cargo run -- demographics --sources "Census2024,VoterDB,BirthRegistry" --detect-manipulation --optimize
```

### 4. Sovereign Identity Grid
**Purpose:** Create symbolic identity maps for citizens, agencies, and services
- **Capabilities:** Link records across fragmented systems (health, finance, legal)
- **Outputs:** Unified identity graph + access control layer

```bash
cargo run -- identity --endpoints "HealthDB,FinanceAPI,LegalSystem" --link-systems --access-control
```

### 5. Policy Impact Simulator
**Purpose:** Model proposed laws, regulations, or budget changes
- **Analysis:** Predict systemic ripple effects using symbolic simulation
- **Outputs:** Impact forecast + entropy risk score

```bash
cargo run -- policy-sim --policy-file policy.json --forecast --entropy-analysis
```

### 6. Civic Dashboard Interface
**Purpose:** Visualize real-time governance health, resource flows, and integrity metrics
- **Features:** Symbolic overlays showing entropy reduction and trust restoration
- **Users:** Enables regulators, auditors, and citizens to interact with civic truth

```bash
cargo run -- dashboard --user-type regulator --real-time --port 8080
```

## üöÄ Quick Start

cargo run -- status
```

### Example: Complete Governance Audit

1. **Track Resource Flows:**
```bash
cargo run -- resource-flow --source "/data/federal_transfers.csv" --detect-anomalies --output report
```

2. **Validate Licenses:**
```bash
cargo run -- licensing --database "/data/licenses.db" --fraud-detection --license-type business
```

3. **Audit Demographics:**
```bash
cargo run -- demographics --sources "census.csv,voters.db,births.json" --detect-manipulation --region "District-1" --optimize
```

4. **Map Identity Systems:**
```bash
cargo run -- identity --endpoints "health.api,finance.db,legal.system" --link-systems --access-control
```

5. **Launch Civic Dashboard:**
```bash
cargo run -- dashboard --user-type regulator --real-time --port 8080
```
Then open: http://localhost:8080

    }
};
```

### Alert Rules

```rust
EscalationRule {
    condition: "corruption_risk_score > 0.7",
    escalation_level: 3,
    notify_roles: vec!["inspector_general", "oversight_committee"],
    auto_actions: vec!["freeze_suspicious_transactions"],
