## EMP/Hack Cascade Logic: Prototype Ideas ⭐

Below are prototype concepts for the EMP/hack cascade logic. Use the star system (★) to judge feasibility, impact, and innovation (1–5 stars each):

### 1. SDR-Triggered EMP Pulse with Mesh Echo
- Use GNU Radio to detect hostile drone signals and trigger a localized EMP pulse.
- Inject a hack payload into affected drones, which then echo the payload to others in mesh range.
- **Feasibility:** ★★★★☆
- **Impact:** ★★★★★
- **Innovation:** ★★★★☆

### 2. Adaptive Frequency EMP/Hack Propagation
- EMP pulse is followed by a frequency-hopping hack payload broadcast (SDR/LoRa).
- Each reclaimed drone adapts its frequency and rebroadcasts, maximizing spread and resilience.
- **Feasibility:** ★★★☆☆
- **Impact:** ★★★★☆
- **Innovation:** ★★★★★

### 3. Compassion Override Swarm Protocol
- EMP disables hostile drones; hack payload boots them into a safe mode, then uploads DominionOS.
- Reclaimed drones join the swarm and propagate the protection protocol, only targeting drones with hostile intent.
- **Feasibility:** ★★★☆☆
- **Impact:** ★★★★★
- **Innovation:** ★★★★★

### 4. Symbolic Signal Chain Reaction
- Each drone encodes the hack payload with a unique symbolic signature, creating a verifiable chain of custody as the cascade spreads.
- Enables audit trails and prevents malicious hijacking of the protocol.
- **Feasibility:** ★★☆☆☆
- **Impact:** ★★★★☆
- **Innovation:** ★★★★★

### 5. Multi-Modal EMP/Hack Delivery
- Combine EMP, SDR, acoustic, and optical (Li-Fi/laser) payload delivery for all-terrain, all-domain propagation.
- Drones select the optimal mode based on environment and adversary countermeasures.
- **Feasibility:** ★★☆☆☆
- **Impact:** ★★★★☆
- **Innovation:** ★★★★★
